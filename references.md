  New research offers insights into what gives work meaning — as well as into common management mistakes 
  that can leave employees feeling that their work is meaningless.

  I’ve used the term Feature Factory at a couple conference talks over the past two years. I started using 
  the term when a software developer friend complained that he was “just sitting in the factory, cranking 
  out features, and sending them down the line.” How do you know if you’re working in a feature factory?

  Software projects are a popular way of funding and organizing software development. They organize work into 
  temporary, build-only teams and are funded with specific benefits projected in a business case. Product-mode 
  instead uses durable, ideate-build-run teams working on a persistent business issue. Product-mode allows teams 
  to reorient quickly, reduces their end-to-end cycle time, and allows validation of actual benefits by using 
  short-cycle iterations while maintaining the architectural integrity of their software to preserve their 
  long-term effectiveness.

  An inside look at the specifics of how we decide what to do and then decide how to do it.
  “How do you guys actually work? How do you choose what to do? How big are your teams? How do you structure 
  the work itself” are questions I get all the time. I’ve been sharing the details in small group workshops 
  and 1 on 1, but figured it was time to write something up so we can share it at large.

  The 'Developer Growth Framework' is a simple spreadsheet/matrix to help identify and clarify appropriate behaviours and    
  expectations for developers at different stages of their careers. It has a summary sheet which has some high level 
  information about expectations for developers across 4 categories '#build' '#deliver' '#lead' and '#connect' and then it 
  deep dives into those 4 categories in more detail with relevant examples. This is simple compared to some other frameworks 
  out there which suited the needs of the teams I worked with but you can also see it as a first step in a journey, making it 
  more detailed and sophisticated over time.
